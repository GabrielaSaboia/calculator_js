_**Explain OOP principles using JavaScript_**

While object oriented programming (OOP) can be a mouth full, and 
increase in complexity rapidly. A basic idea to describe it
is to think of OOP as a way computer scientists have 
found to represent physical things. An _Object_ is a 
representation, or a model, of real world stuff in a computer program.
Ultimately providing a simple way to create functionality that
otherwise might be impossible to use.

**The Four Principles of OOP**

**Encapsulation**

Encapsulation is the bundling of data, and the methods that 
have access to and modify that data. Restricting outside changes
along with hiding its contents.


**Abstraction**

**Inheritance**

**Polymorphism**
